# AutoStory
Prototype plot generator, based on common sources

## Background

A long while ago, I discovered Georges Polti's [The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations) and thought the (far lengthier than the title indicates) list might make a good starting point for automated storytelling.  That is, each chapter/scene/section would be assigned a "dramatic situation" for the characters to resolve in that period.

Therefore, the premise was to take a common plot structure---here, an adaptation of the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)---as an outline and plug in one of the Dramatic Situations for each element, suggesting a character in each role.
